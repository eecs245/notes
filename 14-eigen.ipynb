At the start of the course, we studied the ever-present problem of building models that make meaningful predictions about the future â€“ and rest assured, we will return to that problem shortly. For now, though, we'll start by studying the problem that led to the creation of Google, which you may have once heard of by the phrase \"the billion dollar eigenvalue.\""
