    ":::{admonition} Definition: Symmetric Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix $S$ is **symmetric** if $S = S^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that only square matrices can be symmetric; the transpose of a $n \\times d$ matrix is a $d \\times n$ matrix, and in order for a matrix to be equal to its transpose, we must have $n = d$.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In the style of MIT's Gilbert Strang, I've used $S$ throughout this section to refer to symmetric matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just so we see one, here's an example of a symmetric matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 3 & 5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetric matrices will appear in increasing regularity from here on out, as we start to move back to the study of linear regression. One key symmetric matrix that appears quite frequently is the matrix $X^T X$, where $X$ is **any** $n \\times d$ matrix. That's right: even if $X$ isn't square, $X^T X$ is symmetric! We can verify that this is true by using the properties of the transpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(X^T X)^T = X^T (X^T)^T = X^T X$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $X^T$ is $d \\times n$ and $X$ is $n \\times d$, $X^T X$ is $d \\times d$. This also tells us that $XX^T$ is a $n \\times n$ matrix, and it is also symmetric, as can be verified using the logic above.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is $X^T X$? Let's denote the $j$th column of $X$ as $X_{:, j}$. (This is a bit of notational abuse, but I want to make sure to not use $\\vec x_i$ to denote the $i$th column of $X$, as we've gotten used to referring to the $i$th observation of a dataset as $\\vec x_i$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can write $X^T X$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*} X^TX &= \\begin{bmatrix} - X_{:, 1}^T - \\\\ - X_{:, 2}^T - \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ - X_{:, d}^T - \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mid & \\mid & \\mid \\\\  X_{:, 1} &  X_{:, 2} & \\ldots &  X_{:, d} \\\\ \\mid & \\mid & \\mid \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ &= \\begin{bmatrix}  X_{:, 1} \\cdot  X_{:, 1} &  X_{:, 1} \\cdot  X_{:, 2} & \\ldots &  X_{:, 1} \\cdot  X_{:, d} \\\\  X_{:, 2} \\cdot  X_{:, 1} &  X_{:, 2} \\cdot  X_{:, 2} & \\ldots &  X_{:, 2} \\cdot  X_{:, d} \\\\ & \\vdots & \\\\  X_{:, d} \\cdot  X_{:, 1} &  X_{:, d} \\cdot  X_{:, 2} & \\ldots &  X_{:, d} \\cdot  X_{:, d} \\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}$$\n",

    "This is a $d \\times d$ matrix, where the entry at position $(i, j)$ (and $(j, i)$) is the dot product of the $i$th column of $X$ and the $j$th column of $X$. This matrix is sometimes called the **Gram matrix** of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use case for symmetric matrices is to define quadratic forms. A **quadratic form** is a polynomial in which all terms are of degree two.\n",

    "\n",
    "It turns out that mean squared error, $R_\\text{sq}$, can be expressed as a quadratic form â€“ so we better study how they work. In terms of matrices and vectors, a quadratic form is a function of the form $$q(\\vec x) = \\vec x^T S \\vec x$$ where $S$ is a symmetric matrix. For example, consider the symmetric matrix:\n",

    "\n",
    "Diagonal matrices become useful when studying powers of matrices, like $A^2$ or $A^3$, which we'll need to do in Chapter 5 when we learn about how Google's search algorithm works. If $A$ is an arbitrary $n \\times n$ matrix, then computing $A^2 = AA$ requires us to compute a full matrix multiplication. But, if $D$ is diagonal, then $D^2$ is just a diagonal matrix with each entry squared:\n",

    "\n",
    "Related to the idea of a diagonal matrix is that of an upper triangular matrix. A square matrix $U$ is **upper triangular** if all entries below the diagonal are zero. In other words, $U_{ij} = 0$ for all $i > j$.\n",

One even often studies the **LU decomposition**, which is a factorization of a matrix into an upper triangular matrix and a lower triangular matrix, i.e. $A = LU$. We will spend quite some time on matrix factorizations, but I've chosen to omit the $LU$ decomposition in favor of other factorizations that are more useful for machine learning.\n",

The short answer is that the inverse of a **square** matrix $A$ is the matrix $A^{-1}$ such that $AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I$, and since $Q^TQ = I$, we have $Q^T = Q^{-1}$.
